This is 'Breaking News' android application.The point of building a Real-time news application is to
provide trustworthy breaking news which are trending and
most popular news from Twitter using Twitter API.
1) Android Application: We developed an Android applica-
tion based on React-native. React native framework is used to
build the User Interface of the application. Expo framework is
used when building this application as it provides the required
tools for building the application with ease. Android studio
and VS code platforms were used in building this ’Breaking
News’ mobile application. A simple and clear UI displays
the latest breaking news also taking User’s preferences into
consideration. Modular architecture of this application helps in
maintaining the application along with the re-usability factor.
